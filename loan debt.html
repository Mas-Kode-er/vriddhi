        <h2 style="font-family: Madimi One, sans-serif;"> Education Loan</h2>
        Leading Indian banks play a pivotal role in supporting students' academic aspirations through comprehensive education loans.

        These loans, tailored for both domestic and international higher education, offer a generous repayment period of up to 20 years, starting at an attractive 7.00% per annum interest rate.
        
        The inclusivity of these loans stands out, covering courses from Nursery to full-time, part-time, and higher education, accommodating the diverse needs of working professionals. 
      
       <h2 style="font-family: Madimi One, sans-serif;">What is an Education Loan? </h2> 
      
       Education loan is the financial aid offered by the bank or the loan providers to the candidates who are willing to pursue technical, educational, or other courses abroad. The loan provider allows students to repay the loan after completion of the course and a period of six months is also provided as a grace period until the candidate gets a job. 

<h2 style="font-family: Madimi One, sans-serif;">Types of Education Loan</h2>
<li>Undergraduate education loan for higher education after secondary education. </li>
      
   <li>Post graduate education loan for pursuing courses after completion of undergraduate courses. </li>   
  <li>Career growth education loans for courses, trainings or certification </li> 
  <li> Parents availing education loan for their children </li> 
  Education loans act as a financial lifeline, covering a wide range of expenses including tuition fees, hostel charges, travel costs, insurance premiums, and more. With loan amounts extending up to Rs.1 crore and a flexible repayment tenure of 15 years, students receive substantial support throughout their academic journeys.

Additionally, tax benefits under Section 80E of the Income Tax Act provide relief through deductions on the interest paid.

These loans extend beyond traditional academic paths, including undergraduate, postgraduate, vocational training, and skill development courses. Eligibility criteria encompass enrollment in recognized institutions, completion of 10+2 or a degree, among other factors.

The application process, available through online and offline channels, requires essential documentation such as admission letters and academic records. 
      
In essence, these education loans create a supportive framework, alleviating financial constraints on students' educational endeavors.
